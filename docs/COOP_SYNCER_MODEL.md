# The syncer model — per-element authority, MTA-shape

**Status: DESIGN, 2026-07-20. Not built. Not yet `/qf`-ed.** User directive: introduce the syncer
model into the mod's architecture and begin the full transition to the MTA model.

This is the single largest architectural change since the coop layer was built. It is authorized
under RULE 1 as a hard architectural change.

---

## 1. Why now — three roads turn out to be one road

The directive's own justification is correct, and worth stating precisely because it changes the
cost calculus:

| Road | What it needs | 
|---|---|
| **Authority on the receive path** | Something that answers *"is this peer allowed to change this element?"* at the moment a write arrives, not at the moment one is sent |
| **The arbiter (ROADMAP phase 2 — pulled forward 2026-07-20 from the old phase 8)** | *"authority INVERSION to the true MTA shape — the server holds state + rules + arbitration, clients simulate the world with per-element syncers"* |
| **The MTA migration** (standing rule 2026-05-28) | The syncer model is MTA's core abstraction; read `reference/mtasa-blue/` — `CUnoccupiedVehicleSync.cpp:194-261` is the whole idea in one file |

**These are the same mechanism.** Building it once for security and again for the dedicated server
would be building it twice. The syncer model is the abstraction that survives the inversion: today
the **host process** spawns the arbiter as a child; a dedicated box runs the same binary by hand
against the same element table. The old phase 8 first stopped being a rewrite (it became *"move the
arbiter out of the game process"*) and then stopped being a PHASE at all — the arbiter is born
outside the game process, so there is nothing to move. See `COOP_SERVER_MODEL.md` §2.

That is the strongest available argument for doing it now rather than after the release-gate work —
it is not extra scope, it is the same scope spent once.

---

## 1b. Ordering — architecture FIRST, then security (USER DECISION 2026-07-20)

> *"Стоит архитектуру mta и авторитет модели, синкеры и тд перенять сначала, А ЗАТЕМ УЖЕ ВОПРОСАМИ
> БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ ЗАНИМАТЬСЯ."*

**Everything authority-shaped is DOWNSTREAM of this document, not parallel to it.** A receive path
that accepts a peer's assertion about an element it does not own is not a bug to be patched — it is
the *absence of this architecture*. Patching each site first would build a mechanism this migration
then replaces, which is migration baggage (RULE 2).

**The carve-out, and it is narrow:** anything at the **parse layer**, below the authority question,
is untouched by this migration and is not held behind it — a message is sized, bounded and
type-checked before "who owns this element?" is ever asked. That work is hours on already-verified
sites and nothing here rebuilds it; it shipped separately in `0fcd2003`.

**Peer authentication stays orthogonal.** A syncer assignment is only as trustworthy as the identity
it names, so authenticating peers raises this model's ceiling — but the model is worth building
first, because it is the architecture either way. See §9 question 5.

> **2026-08-24 — this ordering was inverted in practice, and then re-righted by the user.** WP-6 spent

## 1c. DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT (USER 2026-07-20) — the arbiter must be engine-free

> *"хочу чтобы в будущем хост мог создать лобби и dedicated server у него был встроен, и еще
> отдельный dedicated server был как бинарь"*

Three deployment modes for **one** arbiter implementation:

| Mode | Where the arbiter runs | Engine available? |
|---|---|---|
| **Embedded** | Inside the host player's game process (listen-server shape) | Yes — and that is the trap |
| **Headless host** | ROADMAP phase 7 (Wine, the game running headless) | Yes — but **no longer REQUIRED for a zero-player server** as of 2026-07-20; see `COOP_SERVER_MODEL.md` §3 |
| **Standalone binary** | ROADMAP phase 7 (dedicated) | **No** |

**This retires §9 question (f).** Whether the arbiter API is process-agnostic is no longer an open
question — it is a **requirement**, and it decides the API shape before stage 0.

### The consequence, and it is severe

> **The arbiter NEVER reads engine state. It holds its own authoritative copy of everything it
> arbitrates on.**

MTA's proximity check works precisely because the server owns its own positions
(`[V]` `CUnoccupiedVehicleSync.cpp:490-492` compares `pVehicle->GetPosition()` against
`pPlayer->GetPosition()` — both server-side records, never a client's claim and never a render
transform). Every authority predicate we write must be answerable the same way.

**The embedded mode is where this dies quietly.** With the engine right there, reading a live actor
is one call away and always correct *in that mode* — so the portability breaks silently, with no
compile error and no failing test, and is discovered only when the standalone binary is attempted.

### Make it a build invariant, not a discipline

**SUPERSEDED 2026-07-20 — see `docs/COOP_SERVER_MODEL.md` §2.** `[V]` MTA's "host from in-game"
spawns the REAL server binary as a CHILD PROCESS (`Client/mods/deathmatch/logic/CServer.cpp:126-131`),
so there is no embedded build to keep honest: the arbiter is in a different process and *cannot* read
the engine. The invariant below was designed to make the embedded cheat DETECTABLE; a separate
process makes it IMPOSSIBLE. Keep the subtree rule only as belt-and-braces if it is free. Original
proposal follows.

Proposed, and cheap: the arbiter lives in a subtree that **cannot include `ue_wrap/`**, enforced by
the build — not by review. Then "the arbiter is engine-free" is a mechanical, falsifiable property
checked on every compile, and the embedded mode cannot silently cheat.

This also means the arbiter needs its **own element state mirror** (positions, holders, whatever the
predicates read) fed by the engine side in embedded mode and by clients in standalone mode. That
mirror is the real deliverable of stage 0 — bigger than the API, and it is what a dedicated box actually
needs to exist.

## 2. The model

Three concepts, borrowed wholesale (`MTA_PRECEDENT.md` §1):

- **Element** — a synced thing with a stable id. We already have this (`coop/element/`, `ElementId`).
- **Syncer** — the ONE peer currently authorized to author changes for that element. Assigned by the
  arbiter, *pushed* to the peer, never claimed by it.
- **Arbiter** — the authority that assigns syncers and validates inbound writes. Today: the host
  process (spawned as a child). A dedicated box: the same binary, launched by hand. **The code must not care which.**

The invariant, and everything below is a consequence of it:

> **An inbound write is applied only if its sender is the element's current syncer, as recorded by
> the arbiter. Authority is assigned, never asserted.**

---

## 2b. THE ACT-AS-HOST RULE (USER 2026-08-24) — and the boundary where it stops

> *"the approach of host owns (like email and balance), clients just do actions and they go as if
> host itself did that. Probably in some areas this approach is not going to be enough."*
> — and, on the economy specifically: *"Legitimate ways of getting balance like selling items via
> drone container or sell gun are fine if clients do that, these actions from clients are legitimate
> they just go as if host himself sold those items or used sell gun."*

The user is right on both halves, and the second half is the part worth writing down, because the
first half alone is a trap.

**The rule.** For a **discrete, persistent, shared-world** state change, a client never authors the
state. It authors an **intent**; the arbiter performs the change; the result comes back down the
normal host→peer channel. A client's action is not *refused* — it is *re-issued by the authority*.
This is the degenerate case of §2's invariant where the syncer is always the arbiter, and it is what
`order_sync` already ships in SHAPE — `[V]` `order_sync.cpp:224` is host-only and the host re-runs
`makeAnOrder`. **UPDATED 2026-08-24 (evening): the lane now ships BOTH halves and is the rule's reference
implementation.** It used to be the caveat instead — the shape was right while the intent carried
client-chosen values the host wrote through verbatim (**A34/A35**), so every client shopped free. v136
(`afcbff39`) made the intent carry a `list_store` ROW NAME and nothing else; the host prices it from
its own table (`ue_wrap/world/store_catalog`), checks its own balance, rolls its own ETA, confirms the
commit by an `OrderCount()` +1 edge, then charges. A correct act-as-host lane needs both halves — the
arbiter performs it, *and* the arbiter supplies the numbers. **NOT hands-on**; and the lane's own
credit half (a client's sell-gun earnings, A37/A38) is still open, so a client can currently spend the
group's money but not earn it. **It was ATTEMPTED and FAILED, so do not re-derive it from scratch**:
v137 shipped the credit half on 2026-08-24 and the hands-on found it broken four ways the same day —
the intent named the prop by an eid a v122 client never mints, the mirror physics-off never resolved,
the collect seam hooks the wrong one of the credit block's two entries, and the coin's material (which
IS its denomination) is off the wire. The corrected design, four censuses and a build ladder with a
falsifiable verdict per step: `research/findings/inventory-items/votv-v137-field-defects-DESIGN-2026-08-24.md`.

**Why the rule is needed at all — it is not only about cheating.** It has two failure directions and
the register carries one of each:

| direction | what goes wrong | register |
|---|---|---|
| **CHEAT** | the client authors shared state the arbiter never validates | **A12** (email append/delete), **A3**, **A4** |
| **LOSS** | the client's *legitimate* action produces shared state the arbiter never learns of, so it is stomped or diverges | **A13** (a client's earnings never reach the shared balance) |

A design that only defends against the first direction produces the second. That is exactly what
happened to the economy: `BalanceDelta` was deleted as a cheat lane (**A5**) and *nothing* replaced
it, so today the economy only works if the host does all the earning.

**Measured 2026-08-24, and it is worse than "lost".** `[V]` The host broadcasts only on its OWN change
(`balance_sync.cpp:52`), so a client's earning **persists and diverges** — HUD included, since
`lib::addPoints` does its own `SetText` — and then silently vanishes whenever the host's balance next
moves. Meanwhile `prop_destroy_seam.cpp:177` broadcasts destroys for **both** roles: the
**consumption replicates while the credit does not**. A client selling a prop, looting a sack or
opening a chest makes the group **lose the item and gain nothing**. That asymmetry — replicated cost,
unreplicated benefit — is the signature to look for in any lane suspected of this class.

**Where the rule is NOT enough — four measured boundaries.** Do not apply it blindly:

1. **Continuous / locally-predicted state.** Pose at 60 Hz, the desk cursor, the prop in your hands,
   your own look direction. A round-trip through the arbiter is either impossible or feels awful.
   Here §2's general form applies instead: the element's syncer is the acting client, and the
   arbiter *validates* rather than *performs*. This is the whole reason the syncer model is
   per-element and not a global "host authors everything".
2. **Double-delivery.** `event_fire_sync.h:22-31` is the in-tree proof: it suppresses the client
   producer, has the host observe and broadcast — and then replays on the client **only for rows on
   an allowlist**, default NO-replay, *because rows whose outputs already ride another lane would
   double-deliver*. So "host authors, client replays" is incomplete: every act-as-host lane owes a
   statement of what the client re-applies and what it must not, or it duplicates the effect it was
   built to deliver.
3. **Outcomes the arbiter cannot reproduce.** If the client's action resolves against local physics
   or a local roll, the arbiter cannot re-run it and get the same answer; the intent must carry the
   *outcome* and the arbiter must validate it (**A10**'s shape — item provenance), not re-simulate.
4. **Per-player state that is not shared at all.** Your inventory view, your settings, your own
   camera. Making the host author these is pure cost.

**This is NOT a seventh authority model — read §4b before you think it is.** §4b measured ~6 authority
models already living in `session_lanes.h:179`'s comments and warns that adding a parallel table is
RULE 2. Act-as-host is not a competitor to that taxonomy: it is **the model §4b's `SYMMETRIC` bucket
should be promoted to**. §4b already says `SYMMETRIC` "is not a model, it is the absence of one" and
that those 13 kinds are finding A4 — act-as-host is the name of what fills that absence. So §4b's
corrected direction (*promote the existing taxonomy from comments into the type, one model at a time*)
is the delivery mechanism for this rule, not an alternative to it. `[/qf` R1 asked exactly this and
the original text of §2b did not answer it.`]`

**The test to apply** (four steps — the third was added 2026-08-24 when the economy census showed the
three-step version could not decide the very case that motivated the rule):

1. *Is the state shared and persistent?* — if not, boundary 4.
2. *Can the arbiter **learn of** the trigger?* — and this step asks TWO things, which the first
   version of it conflated. **CORRECTED 2026-08-24 (evening), by building the counter-example to
   its own claim.**

   The original text said: *"this is the step that actually blocks us — all 19 of the game's credit
   sites are `EX_LocalVirtualFunction`, so no ProcessEvent hook can see an earning; the answer to
   'why isn't the economy host-authoritative yet' is dispatch visibility, not design."* That is
   **too strong, and the laptop-shop fix (v136) is the proof**: it charges a client's purchase to
   the shared balance without hooking `addPoints` at all.

   The two questions are:

   - **(a) Can the arbiter HOOK the trigger?** For the 19 credit sites, no — `[V]` all are
     `EX_LocalVirtualFunction`, invisible to both the ProcessEvent detour and a `UFunction::Func`
     patch.
   - **(b) Can the acting client point at an ARTIFACT the arbiter can resolve?** Often yes, and
     that is enough. A shop purchase leaves a **persistent, pollable artifact** — an appended row in
     `saveSlot.orders` — so `order_sync` produces a real intent with no hook anywhere, and the
     arbiter prices it from its own table.

   So the honest scope is: **the DEBIT direction is not blocked; the CREDIT direction is** — because
   a debit leaves an order row and a credit leaves only a number. And not even all of the credit
   direction: `[V]` `baocoin_C` is a real world actor carrying an int `points`, and `[V]` its pickup
   is `BndEvt__baocoin_collect_..._ComponentBeginOverlapSignature__DelegateSignature`, a
   component-bound multicast delegate dispatched through `ProcessDelegate -> ProcessEvent` — i.e.
   PE-VISIBLE and interceptable. The sell gun has an artifact too.

   What is genuinely blocked on `0x45` (`docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md`) is a credit whose ONLY
   trace is the balance itself: a point sack, a treasure chest, an ATM deposit, an achievement
   award. For those there is nothing to name but the number, and naming the number is A5 reinvented.

   **The generalisable form of this step: does the arbiter have a SOURCE?** If yes, the intent names
   an identity and the arbiter derives the value. If no, you are at boundary 3 — the intent must
   carry the outcome and the arbiter must validate it. `docs/security/TRACKER.md`'s five-signature
   section applies exactly this split to the register's 12 "client-authored value" rows and finds
   nine on the first side and two (A12, A25) on the second.
3. *Can the arbiter **perform** the change from an intent?* — if not, boundary 3: the intent must
   carry the outcome and the arbiter validates it.
4. *Would replaying it on the client double an effect another lane already carries?* — if yes,
   boundary 2: an allowlist with a NO-replay default.

**And state, per lane, WHICH SIDE IS SUPPRESSED.** A12's lesson is explicit that the fix for a
producer-polled lane is **client-side producer suppression**, never a receive-side gate, which would
silently lose legitimate client-produced state — that is precisely how the CHEAT fix creates the LOSS
defect. `[V]` The one economy path that works proves it: `drone_sync.cpp:150,241` suppresses the
**client's drone tick**, so only the host ever runs the sale. A lane that does not name its suppressed
side is not specified.

**THE ARBITER'S VALUES ARE CANONICAL EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ABSURD (USER 2026-08-24).**

> *"if host cheats thats fine, if he alters his balance to 99999 — that's also fine as he's the owner,
> he's the host. We have to relay whatever the host has cheated (balance, whatever else)."*

This constrains the rule in a direction that is easy to get wrong while "hardening" something. The
arbiter is not a referee applying rules to itself — it is the definition of truth. So **every bound,
clamp or plausibility check this model adds is CLIENT-SCOPED; a symmetric check is a bug**, because it
would override the host's prerogative over their own world. Write the role into the check, or do not
write the check. The existing correct shape is `balance_sync::CreditLocal`: it credits on host/solo,
refuses only on a CONNECTED CLIENT, and the host's poll broadcasts the result like any other change —
a host-side cheat is a BROADCAST, not an exception. Full statement: `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`,
"The host may cheat, and we RELAY it".

**An intent may name WHAT. It must never carry WHAT IT COSTS.** `[V]` `order_sync` was the lane
that proved the rule by breaking it: the intent carried a client-chosen `price` and class the host
wrote through verbatim (**A34/A35**), so every connected client shopped free by default. Fixed in
v136 (`afcbff39`) — the arbiter prices the action from its own tables. Two things that pass generalise
beyond the price: the intent must name an identity the arbiter can RESOLVE (`[V]` a class name could
not even do that — 473 shop rows map onto 368 classes, so 112 were not uniquely nameable), and the
value the arbiter derives must come from its OWN copy, which is the same rule `roach_sync.cpp:453-461`
still breaks by resolving against client-supplied coordinates (**A27**).

**Status: recorded 2026-08-24 from the user's directive; revised the same day by a `/qf` round and by
two read-only censuses (economy + client-producer).** The four boundaries and the four-step test are
code-cited; the rule has NOT been `/qf`-ed to convergence as an architecture. It lives here rather than
in a new file because it is a statement about §2's invariant. Census findings are in the register
(`docs/security/TRACKER.md`), not here.

## 3. What we already have (measured 2026-07-20)

Encouraging: most of the primitives exist. This is a promotion, not a green field.

| Piece | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Stable element identity | `coop/element/`, `ElementId` | **Built** |
| A per-element owner field | `element.h:201-202` `GetOwnerSlot`/`SetOwnerSlot` | **Built — but WRONG SEMANTICS, see §4** |
| Per-slot teardown by owner | `mirror_manager.h:357` `DrainMirrorsForSlot` | **Built** |
| A holder table with a lookup | `device_occupancy.h:72` `HolderOf(key)` | **Built, but ADVISORY** — read by senders, never on receive |
| Leaver teardown for claims | `device_occupancy.h:79` `OnDisconnectForSlot` | **Built** — a large part of the Principle-8 answer already exists |
| Join-time claim seeding | `device_occupancy.h:75` `QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot` | **Built** |
| A correct receive-side check, at ONE site | `trash_grab_intent.cpp:298-302` | **Built** — this is the pattern to generalize |
| Sender identity bound to transport | `VerifySenderEidRange`, `HandleAssignPeerSlot` | **Built** (per the audit's "checked and clean") |

| A receive-side ARBITER on a real lane | `container_contents_sync.cpp` `HostAcceptsClientWrite` | **Built 2026-07-22 (v125, `411743af`)** — see the note below |

**What is missing is not the data. It is the enforcement point and a coherent notion of who assigns.**

### 3b. The first shipped arbiter (2026-07-22, R11b) — what it teaches this design

The container-contents lane is now the first place where a peer's write is VALIDATED ON RECEIVE
rather than trusted. Three things it measured are inputs to §5:

1. **Intent lanes are not available for `EX_Local*` verbs.** `takeObj` has already run on the presser
   before any seam of ours exists, so "client asks, host decides" cannot be built. The arbiter's real
   shape here is **validate-on-receive of presser-authored state**, not request/grant. Any §5 enforcement
   point that assumes it can DENY BEFORE the actor changes is wrong for this whole class of verb.
2. **A validated-write lane needs a base, and the base is a separate fact from every other hash it
   looks like.** The lane needed FOUR maps (published / sent / applied / base) and each collapse produced
   a live failure ([[lesson-one-cache-per-question-not-per-write-moment]]).
3. **A refusal is only half an answer, and the missing half is where the OBJECT went.** Measured
   consequence (reasoned 2026-07-22, not yet reproduced): refusing a client's container write restores
   the container but leaves the extracted item in that peer's own inventory — the refusal re-creates the
   duplication it exists to prevent. **§6 (claim transfer) and §5 must therefore treat "revert the
   loser's local effect" as part of the enforcement point, not a later nicety.** This is the concrete
   form of the rollback question, and the user's 2026-07-22 ruling is: inventory becomes canon, the
   rollback is built only once the refusal counter shows conflicts actually occur.

---

## 4. The trap: `ownerSlot` is NOT the syncer — do not fuse them

`[V]` `element.h:220` — `m_ownerSlot` is documented as *"originating peer slot for mirrors (D1-7);
-1 = none"*, and `mirror_manager.h:357` `DrainMirrorsForSlot` uses it to **destroy a departed peer's
mirrors**.

That is **birth authorship**, and it is load-bearing for teardown. The syncer is **current write
authority**, and it must be *reassignable* — that is the whole point of MTA's `OverrideSyncer`.

Fusing them would mean: reassigning a syncer silently re-targets which mirrors get destroyed when a
peer leaves. That is a data-loss bug, and it is exactly the failure family in
`[[lesson-single-latch-fused-states-gate-semantics]]` — one field, two meanings, and the gate reads
the wrong one.

**Decision: the syncer is a SECOND field**, beside `m_ownerSlot`, with its own lifetime. They will
frequently hold the same value; they are not the same concept and must never be aliased.

### A second identity space to reconcile

`[V]` `device_occupancy` is keyed by **device key** (`HolderOf(const wchar_t* key)`), while elements
are keyed by **`ElementId`**. These are two parallel authority spaces today.

Per `[[feedback-qf-enumerate-identity-maps-on-migration]]`, this must be resolved *before* building,
not discovered during: either devices become elements, or the arbiter owns two keyed tables with one
predicate over both. **Open question — see §9.**

---

## 4b. `/qf` R1-R2 REFRAMED THIS DOC THREE TIMES — read before §5-§8

§5 and §8 below are **superseded in shape** by what two critic rounds measured. Kept for the
reasoning trail; the corrected direction is here.

### R1 — the syncer is not the claim (a retirement I nearly reverted)

`[V]` v116 RETIRED the claim-gated receive check as a RULE-1 root fix:
`[[lesson-claim-anchored-gate-races-its-own-release]]`. Measured live 17:04:46/47 — the client's
successful ping wrote `coord_signalData`, the *same* success dropped `coord_isPing`, so both the
catch detector and the host validator `holder==sender` raced a release **the detected event itself
triggers**, and the baseline roll-forward made the loss permanent.

`[V]` I then verified the two MTA citations personally (my own Rule S5 debt):
`CUnoccupiedVehicleSync.cpp:285` and `:490-492`, both verbatim as reported. **MTA's syncer is a
LONG-LIVED ASSIGNMENT, not released by the events it syncs** — takeover is a separate rate-limited
path. Our `device_occupancy` is a per-interaction claim whose lifetime is event-coupled.

**Building syncers on the claim table would inherit that lifetime and revive the v116 race at 68x
scale.** Hence three concepts, never aliased: `m_ownerSlot` (birth authorship, drives teardown) ·
**claim** (occupancy, event-coupled, UI/coordination) · **syncer** (write authority,
arbiter-assigned, event-DECOUPLED).

### R2a — assigned authority fits streams, not discrete verbs

MTA's model self-heals because the traffic is a continuous position stream: a rejected packet is
replaced 50 ms later. **Our discrete state writes do not self-heal — a rejection is a lost player
action.** So one syncer check across all 68 kinds is wrong on its face.

### R2b — the per-kind authority taxonomy ALREADY EXISTS, in comments

`[V]` `session_lanes.h:179` `IsClientRelayableReliableKind` is already a per-kind, receive-side
table, and its comments encode an authority model per kind:

| Model in the tree | Example kinds |
|---|---|
| `PRESSER-authored` | `DeskInput`, `DeskSndFx`, `PlayDeckEvent` |
| `CLAIM-OWNER-authoritative` | `DishAimState` — **the exact shape v116 retired** |
| `OCCUPANT-OR-GRABBER-authoritative` | `AtvState` |
| `HOST-TERMINAL intent/result` | `DriveSlotState` — client organic edges are speculative intents; host expected-eid validation and canonical state win |
| `HOST-TERMINAL data intent/result` | `DrivePayload` — client rows terminate at the host; clients apply only host-authored rows |
| `SYMMETRIC` | doors, lights, containers, garage, appliance, locker, power — **this is finding A4** |

**~6 authority models already live here.** The syncer would be a seventh. And a new per-kind table
at stage 3 would be a **second parallel table** beside this one — RULE 2.

### The corrected direction

1. **Promote the existing taxonomy from comments into the type** — each kind declares its authority
   model explicitly, beside the relay flag, in **one** table.
2. **Make it enforced on receive, one MODEL at a time** — not one handler at a time out of 68.
3. **Introduce the syncer only where a peer genuinely SIMULATES what the arbiter cannot compute.**
   MTA needs syncers because the client simulates an unoccupied vehicle and the server does not.
   Where our host already computes the truth, "syncer" would be a mere permission label — a simpler
   thing, and it should stay simpler.
4. **`SYMMETRIC` is not a model, it is the absence of one.** Those 13 kinds are A4. That is where
   the work actually is.

### Still unanswered (carried into R3+)

- **Which of the 68 kinds have peer-local simulation the arbiter cannot run?** Decides where syncers
  are real vs a label.
- **Can a discrete lane accept rejection + retry at all?** Or must the invariant be that a
  reassignment can *never* invalidate an in-flight write? Must be read from a real discrete lane
  before stage 0 shapes the API around the wrong answer.

## 5. The enforcement point

`[V]` The A4 surface is **68 `case` branches** (`event_dispatch_state.cpp` 24,
`event_dispatch_signal.cpp` 29, `event_dispatch_entity.cpp` 15). Auditing 68 handlers by hand
guarantees a miss and creates 68 places to keep in sync.

MTA's answer (`MTA_PRECEDENT.md` §5) is a **default-deny per-kind flag** checked **once** in the
dispatch switch, before the handler runs:

1. **Per-kind `bAllowClientAuthored`, defaulting to `false`.** A kind that a client may legitimately
   author must say so explicitly. Everything else is refused without the handler ever seeing it.
2. **For kinds that ARE client-authorable: the syncer check**, at the same single point —
   `SyncerOf(elementId) == senderSlot`.
3. **A generation counter beside the check** — MTA's `CanUpdateSync(ucTimeContext)`, bumped whenever
   the arbiter itself changes the element, so a stale-but-authorized packet cannot be replayed.

This mirrors what `session_lanes.h:181-185` already does for **relaying**. The same idea applied to
**applying** is the missing half — and note the ordering rule from `RULES.md` S2: validate *before*
relay. MTA itself gets this wrong (`MTA_PRECEDENT.md` §2 caution); we should not copy that.

---

## 6. Claim transfer — the part that makes it usable

A pure "only the syncer may write" rule produces permanently stuck objects. MTA's answer
(`MTA_PRECEDENT.md` §3) is that a **non**-syncer may *request* takeover, granted only after the
arbiter validates, against its **own** state:

1. requester is not already the syncer,
2. a **cooldown** since the last takeover (`MIN_PUSH_ANTISPAM_RATE` = 1500 ms),
3. **arbiter-side proximity** — checked against the arbiter's copy of both positions, never the
   requester's claim,
4. same world context.

And on refusal, MTA sends an explicit failure **reply** (`CGame.cpp:3042`) so the requester rolls
back its local prediction. **We currently drop silently**, which desyncs the asker.

## 7. Principle 8 — the late-join answers this owes

Per CLAUDE.md principle 8 and `RULES.md` S6, a new authority lane is not done until every row here
is implemented, not merely acknowledged.

| Case | Answer | Existing machinery |
|---|---|---|
| Syncer departs mid-activity | Arbiter reaps the syncer on departure and reassigns or clears | `device_occupancy::OnDisconnectForSlot` already does this for claims |
| Peer joins mid-activity | Syncer assignments ride the join snapshot | `QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot` is the precedent |
| Syncer stalls / crashes without a clean departure | **TTL on the assignment**, reaped by the arbiter's tick | `device_occupancy::Tick` exists |
| Two peers race a takeover | Arbiter is the single writer; first-writer-wins, loser gets an explicit refusal | §6 |
| Element born mid-session | Birth assigns a syncer atomically with the eid | `[[lesson-identity-migrate-at-birth-covers-every-map]]` |

---

## 8. Migration — staged, because this touches lanes the user has hands-on tested

**Do not big-bang this.** Ordered so that behaviour-changing steps land last and observably.

| Stage | What | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Write the arbiter abstraction + the `SyncerOf`/`AssignSyncer` API. No callers. | None |
| **1** | Arbiter becomes the **single writer** of syncer state; assignments broadcast. **No enforcement** — pure observation. Verify by log diff that assignments match today's implicit behaviour. | Low — no behaviour change |
| **2** | Principle-8 answers (§7): reap on departure, seed on join, TTL, race rule. Still no enforcement. Smoke: a peer leaving mid-desk-use frees the desk. | Low |
| **3** | Per-kind `bAllowClientAuthored` flag, **defaulting to false**, one check in the dispatch switch. Enumerate the 68 kinds and mark the legitimately client-authored ones. | **Medium — this is where a missed `true` breaks real play** |
| **4** | Syncer check on the client-authorable kinds + generation counter. Family by family, smoke between. Start with the desk chain, where the claim machinery is most mature. | **Highest** |
| **5** | Takeover request/grant (§6) + the explicit refusal reply. | Medium |
| **6** | RULE 2: retire the advisory reads of `device_occupancy` that stage 4 makes redundant. | Low |

Stages 3-4 are a wire-format change → **`kProtocolVersion` bump**, per the standing rule.

## 9. Open questions — resolve in `/qf` BEFORE stage 0

Per `[[feedback-qf-before-implementation]]`, this design gets a full pass before any code.

1. **The two identity spaces (§4).** Do devices become elements, or does the arbiter hold two keyed
   tables behind one predicate? This is the enumerate-identity-maps question and it is load-bearing.
2. **What is the syncer of a world prop nobody holds?** MTA assigns an unoccupied vehicle's syncer by
   proximity; our equivalent may be "the host, always" for most props — in which case the model
   collapses pleasantly for the majority of elements.
3. **Does the host, as a player, get syncer status for free on its own actions?** It is both arbiter
   and peer. The asymmetry needs one explicit rule, not per-site judgement.
4. **Enumerating the 68 kinds** into client-authorable vs not. This is the bulk of stage 3 and the
   most error-prone part; it wants its own review pass.
5. **Interaction with `PLAN_01` (peer auth).** A syncer assignment is only as trustworthy as the
   peer identity it names. Syncers make authority *consistent*; certificates make identity *real*.
   Neither substitutes for the other — but does stage 4 have any value before P1 lands?
6. **Dedicated-deployment forward compatibility.** Is the arbiter API genuinely process-agnostic, or does it
   quietly assume in-process engine access? If it assumes, the dedicated-deployment payoff evaporates and we
   should know that now.

---

## 10. What this does NOT do

- It does not authenticate *who* a peer is — that is a separate arc, and the assignment is only as
  trustworthy as the identity it names.
- It does not protect a client from a hostile **host** — the host is the arbiter, and a joining
  client adopts the host's save wholesale. That trust surface is untouched here and is the hardest
  open problem in the model.
- It does not make the host's simulation authoritative over physics. Per the retired-phase-8 note in ROADMAP, server-side
  authoritative physics without the engine is *"a decade-class trap"*; the inversion is about **rules
  and state machines**, not simulation.
