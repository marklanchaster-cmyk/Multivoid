"""VOTV coop launcher / autonomous LAN smoke orchestrator.

Replaces the .bat-piped powershell-pipeline chain that buffer-deadlocked under
redirected stdio (cmd.exe + powershell child + ps1 deploy script + VotV
detached spawn -> tail caller never sees output until VotV exits).

Subcommands:
  host        deploy + launch HOST peer (Game_0.9.0n_HOST/)
  client      deploy + launch CLIENT #1 peer (Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_1/)
  client2     deploy + launch CLIENT #2 peer (Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_2/) -- 2026-05-28
              added for 3-peer LAN tests of the GNS multi-peer wire layer.
  client3     deploy + launch CLIENT #3 peer (Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_3/) -- 2026-05-30
              the 4th game folder; completes a 4-peer (host + 3 client) set.
  smoke       autonomous 2-peer LAN smoke (non-regression quick-check)
  smoke4      autonomous 4-PEER LAN smoke (Tier 8) -- host + 3 clients, staggered
              connect, then LOG-DRIVEN cross-peer relay verdict. This is the
              only scenario that exercises the Tier 2 host-relay end-to-end:
              with <3 clients the relay fan-out is a no-op (host-only, finds no
              other client). The verdict proves "client A actually sees client
              B" by parsing each client's log for a puppet auto-spawned on
              ANOTHER client's slot -- a marker the old star topology could
              never produce (a client only ever saw the host at slot 0).
  kill        SIGTERM all VotV-Win64-Shipping instances

Every step prints a [mp] line immediately (flushed) so a Bash caller never has
to guess what the orchestrator is doing. Child VotV is launched DETACHED so
the parent Python exits cleanly without VotV inheriting our pipes.

Used by mp_host_game.bat / mp_client_connect.bat / mp_client2_connect.bat /
mp_smoke.bat which are thin shims at repo root (per the user RULE: "FOR ME
TO RUN YOU MUST MAKE A BAT AND PUT IT PROJECTS ROOT").

# --- Per-process commit limit via Win32 Job Objects ---

# 2026-05-28 (host launched with -WinX=0 -WinY=0 on a multi-monitor virtual
# desktop ate 18 GB before the user could kill it). A Job Object with
# JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY caps the per-process commit. The kernel
# fails further VirtualAlloc once the limit is hit -- UE4 either retries
# at a smaller size, logs an OOM, or crashes. Either way the process stops
# growing past the cap. Critically: the limit is a property of the job
# object, NOT of our handle, so it stays in effect after mp.py exits and
# VotV is left running standalone.

# --- Physics-divergence test signals (smoke_phystele, 2026-06-09) -------------
# Reproduces + auto-detects the client world-divergence physics failure (the
# bug two builds shipped blind because the plain smoke can't see it):
#   - host loads s_1234 (populated), client boots FRESH -> the asymmetry IS the
#     bug (host disk-asleep props vs client independent-RNG New Game).
#   - THE deterministic signal: count `diverged (d=...cm)` lines in the client
#     log = how many divergent RNG props the client GENERATED and had to
#     teleport-reconcile. Current build -> hundreds (FAIL/reproduces). After the
#     spawner-suppression fix -> ~0 (client generates none; host props arrive via
#     Path C fresh-spawn). This does NOT depend on RNG FPS luck.
#   - safety nets: `posted task FAULT` (the grep the last smoke MISSED), the
#     game's own Fatal error / EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (the PhysX worker-thread
#     crash is process-death, NOT caught by our game-thread SEH -> peer-count<2 is
#     the primary catcher), post-settle FPS lock, RSS growth.

        SELFTEST DISARMED -- our window was not the FOREGROUND window for 15000 ms

    That refusal is CORRECT and must stay: the selftest synthesizes clicks and key
    presses, and input synthesized while another window is foreground lands in that
    window -- a lab that types into the user's editor is worse than a lab that fails.
    The defect was on this side: mp.py launched the game and simply HOPED it would be
    foreground, with no line of code anywhere that tried to make it so. Windows will
    not let a freshly-launched process steal focus from the active one, so whenever the
    run was started from a terminal that kept focus, the harness could not create the
    single precondition it required of itself.

    `AttachThreadInput` is the documented way out: a thread attached to the foreground
    thread's input queue is permitted to call `SetForegroundWindow`. Attach to BOTH the
    current foreground thread and the target's, move the window, then detach -- leaving
    the queues attached would make this process share input state with the game.

    Returns the VERIFIED result (a fresh `GetForegroundWindow` read), never the return

    """Autonomous regression test for the join-churn class of bug. Originally guarded the 2026-06-17
    reconcile-once latch band-aid; since 2026-06-18 it verifies the R1-R4 MTA refactor that REPLACED
    that latch (R1 incremental per-prop streaming + R3 membership-bounded sweep).

    Reproduces the EXACT reported bug: the HOST loads the populated s_1234 (its garbage/ambient
    spawners mint chipPiles continuously), a FRESH client joins, and the host's steady-world re-seed
    adopts new props every few seconds. The OLD bug: each adoption re-fired a FULL bracketed
    re-snapshot, re-arming the client's DESTRUCTIVE divergence sweep ~10x in one join -- thrashing the
    piles + dooming kerfur mirrors (the "piles lost sync / kerfurs come alive by themselves" report).
    R1 fixed it at the SOURCE: the re-seed now broadcasts ONE bracket-free incremental PropSpawn per
    new prop (MTA CEntityAddPacket), so no bracket re-arms the sweep. R3 made the sweep
    membership-bounded (it only adjudicates the client's OWN local Prop Elements; host-driven mirrors
    are excluded at the source), so a re-fire can no longer doom a kerfur mirror or wipe the world.

    Then it spawns a kerfur on the host -- exercising the kerfur-mirror path (it must mirror + PERSIST,
    not be doomed by the sweep -> no spurious POLL flip-flop). The host's continuous ambient chipPile
    spawns drive the R1 incremental marker.

    Screenshots are captured at FOUR situations: A=mid-join churn, B=post-reconcile, C=kerfur present,
    D=steady-state. PASS requires: both peers alive + connected; the R1 incremental PropSpawn delta
    FIRED (>=1, HOST log); the sweep fired only a few times (<= --max-sweeps, NOT the ~10 churn);
    bounded destroy-sweeps + no-local-match flood; the kerfur mirrored with no flip-flop loop."""

    Question: when a CLIENT exits to the menu with the coop layer LIVE (a player's
    own in-game exit), does it LEAK wire traffic about its dying world during the
    <=4 s purge-blind window before the flee's poll notices -- traffic the host
    then APPLIES to its healthy world? Zero leakage -> D2 (the world-identity
    gate) stays deferred; any leakage -> D2 re-prioritizes.

    Mechanism: host runs with VOTVCOOP_WIRE_CENSUS=1 (every inbound reliable
    logged individually + 1 Hz aggregated stream counts, each line stamped with
    GetTickCount64() -- machine-global ms, so the two logs align exactly). The
    client runs the menutravel probe in WAIT_SESSION + NO_BYPASS mode: join, dwell

    WHY IT IS A SOLO HOST AND NOT A SESSIONLESS ONE. The probe is reached from
    net_pump::Tick -> subsystems::TickGameplay, and session_runtime.cpp calls net_pump::Tick
    only when the session is running -- a sessionless launch takes the branch that calls
    subsystems::Install and nothing else. So `running()` is a PRECONDITION of reaching the
    probe at all, which is why the probe's own guard is on connectedPeerCount() (zero peers),
    not on running(). Guarding on running() made it unreachable on every launch.

    WHAT IT ASSERTS. The selftest states the DEFECT first -- with the group's gate shut, the
    switch's own verb (runTrigger index 0) must NOT move the group -- so a green result cannot
    come from the group having been movable all along. Then that ApplyGroupState moves it
    ANYWAY (the absolute setters ignore the gate, which is what lets a receiver land the
    authority's state on a peer whose own breaker is off), that it restores, and that the RAII
    hold put the gate back. That last one is asserted rather than assumed because the field is
    SAVE-PERSISTENT: a leaked shut gate follows the player into single-player and every switch
    in that group flips, clicks, and moves no light, permanently.

    MUTATING, SO NEVER TWO PEERS. Armed on a host during `mp.py smoke` it cost the client its
    join (PASS with the flag off, "expected 2 peers, got 1" with it on, twice). launch_peer
    strips the env var from the ambient environment; this scenario is the one place that puts

# WHY THIS EXISTS. `kill_all()` above is `Stop-Process -Force`, i.e. TerminateProcess. It sends no
# WM_CLOSE, our wndproc therefore never runs, and a forced kill delivers no DLL_PROCESS_DETACH
# either. So `coop::shutdown::DoShutdown()` -> `ue_wrap::hook::Shutdown()` -- our ENTIRE teardown --
# had never executed under an AUTOMATED SCENARIO, on any build. (It HAS run under a human close on
# the proxy lane: docs/piles/test-evidence/handson-s31/s32 carry the marker. What had never happened
# is a teardown with a co-resident PolyHook composed onto our relay.) Measured 2026-08-26;
# docs/UE4SS_ARC.md section 4a.
#
# That was blocking, and what it was hiding turned out to be bigger than the residual it was built
# for: `[V]` removing a MinHook hook CORRUPTS its trampoline in place -- MH_RemoveHook -> FreeBuffer
# writes a linked-list pointer over the slot's first eight bytes, i.e. over the stolen prologue a
# thread may be about to return through -- and MH_Uninitialize then unmaps it, both while the process
# is still running. Shipping a fix for that without this scenario would be a change to code no test
# runs -- unfalsifiable by construction. This makes the path observable FIRST, so the fix can be
# shown RED and then GREEN.
#
# It is deliberately ADDITIVE. `kill_all()` is untouched and every other scenario still tears down
# exactly the way it always has; nothing here changes an existing verdict.

    gate REFUSES. A gate that has never refused anything is an unproven gate, and
    the only thing that distinguishes it from `return true` is a run like this.

    THE SABOTAGE IS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE (`[dev] auth_drill`). The host's gate has
    no knob, no dev branch and no env check anywhere -- so what this drills is the
    shipped refusal, not a test hook. Two arms:

      corrupt -- the client verifies the host, then sends a proof with one bit
                 flipped. The host must REFUSE and close.
      silent  -- the client verifies the host and then says nothing. The host must
                 close it on the pending deadline. Slower by design: the deadline
                 is 30 s because it must clear the slowest legitimate handshake.
      mismatch-- the client is told it was sent to a DIFFERENT host than the one
                 that answered, and must refuse ITSELF before emitting anything
                 (security A65). The only arm whose refusal is the client's, so
                 N1 reads the CLIENT's log; the host merely sweeps a socket that
                 never spoke.
      password-- the host requires a lobby password and the client offers the
                 WRONG one (security A2). Both peers prove their identities
                 normally, so this drills the password gate ALONE rather than
                 the exchange around it -- which is the only way to know the
                 padlock is a gate and not a badge.

    Asserted, per arm, from the HOST's own log and the CLIENT's:
      N1 the host REFUSED / swept this connection, naming why
      N2 the client NEVER took a seat        (no "host assigned us peer slot")
      N3 the host NEVER served the save      (A57's world half is what this buys)
      N4 the host's seat count stayed at zero

    all four -- otherwise a drill that fails to connect for an unrelated reason
    reports a refusal it never caused.

    """AUTO host + an unreachable master: does the session stay JOINABLE, or is it a world
    nobody can reach?

    THE ASSERTION IS A BOUND UDP SOCKET, not a log line. Until 2026-09-01 an AUTO host whose
    announce failed kept `Topology::P2P` and dialled the fallback signaling server. `Start()`
    is either/or (`session_start.cpp`: P2P ? StartP2P : StartLanDirect), so NO listen socket
    existed -- and the status line told the player "LAN/direct only", the two things that
    configuration did not have. A joiner also needs the host's `gen:` identity to dial a P2P
    host and only /v1/join publishes it, so an unlisted P2P host is unreachable even when its
    signaling is healthy.

    Why this scenario exists at all: the rig's ordinary host boots straight into
    `StartCoopSession(netCfg)` from the resolved config (`harness.cpp:357`) and never enters
    `HostWithSave`, where the fallback lives. So no existing scenario could reach the code
    under test. `VOTVCOOP_TEST_HOST_SAVE` (the shipped picker arm in `ui/overlay_test_arm`)
    is the one door that does, and it calls HostWithSave with directConnection=false --
    exactly the AUTO path.

    CAVEAT ON `--master`, MEASURED 2026-09-01 AND NOT YET FIXED: the arm fires from overlay
    init, which is EARLIER than `harness.cpp:108`'s `session_manager::Configure` -- so
    `g_masterUrl` is still its compiled default when the announce goes out and the env
    override does not reach it. What actually fails the announce on this rig is the durable
    identity also not being loaded yet, so /v1/host answers a named 400. The branch under
    test is gated on `info.ok` alone and is therefore still exercised, which is why A2/A3
    remain valid -- but do not read a pass here as "an unreachable master was simulated".
    harness.cpp:105 states the intended invariant ("BEFORE any browser action can fire") and
    it holds for real CLICKS; this arm is not a click and slips underneath it.

    PASS requires all three:
      1. the announce actually FAILED (else this measured a healthy master, not the fallback),
      2. the host holds a UDP endpoint on --port  -- the differential; the old build had none,
      3. the session came up on LanDirect, from `net: session started ... topology=LanDirect`.
