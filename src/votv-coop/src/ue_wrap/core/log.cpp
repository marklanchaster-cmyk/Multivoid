// A UTF-8 locale used for FORMATTING ONLY, never installed process-wide.
//
// MEASURED 2026-07-28, and it had been silently eating log lines since the first
// Cyrillic nickname: `%ls` in vsnprintf converts wide -> narrow through the C
// locale, and the default "C" locale can encode nothing above U+007F. The call
// returns -1 and MSVC leaves the buffer EMPTY, so the whole line degenerates to
// a bare "[21:04:18] [INFO ] " with no message at all -- not truncated, GONE.
// Every line naming a Cyrillic, CJK or emoji peer vanished, which is precisely
// the population the international-names work exists for, and it is why an
// arc-D2 drill looked like a relay failure: the evidence lines were missing, not
// the behaviour. (Probe: `%ls` of "Пел" -> n=-1; with this locale -> n=17.)
//
// _create_locale + the _l formatter keep this to OUR call. setlocale() would be
// the two-line version and is wrong here: we are injected into someone else's
// process, and LC_CTYPE is shared CRT state the game also reads.
//
// LC_CTYPE, **NOT** LC_ALL -- one token, and the audits caught it independently.
// ".UTF-8" leaves the language/country to the OS user default, and LC_ALL drags
// LC_NUMERIC along with it: on a ru-RU machine every `%f` in the log turned into
// `1,50`. Measured side by side -- plain `1.50`, LC_ALL `1,50`, LC_CTYPE `1.50`,
// and LC_CTYPE converts `%ls` exactly as well (`n=9` for a Cyrillic+CJK+emoji
// string, against `n=-1` plain). 301 log call sites carry a float and mp.py
// parses numbers out of them, so LC_ALL would have made every peer's log
// machine-dependent to fix a character-conversion bug.

//
// MEASURED 2026-08-29, and it cost a whole diagnosis: a real r2modman session ran
// for four minutes and left a 65-line log ending mid-boot. Nothing was wrong with
// the mod -- `multivoid.ini.example` was regenerated at 20:03:38, the very step
// whose INFO line is missing -- the game simply closed without reaching Shutdown()
// (no `shutdown: END cleanup` block), and the CRT's ~4 KB buffer died with it.
// Every INFO line since the last WARN was lost, which is precisely the window a
// post-mortem needs.
//
// The pre-existing answer was ~20 explicit Flush() calls at hand-picked milestones.
// That is a SITE LIST, and it fails the way site lists fail: it covers the paths
// someone anticipated, and the session that actually broke was not one of them.
// The invariant replaces the list -- the log is handed to a background flush
// within kFlushIntervalMs, whatever happens next and whoever writes.
//
// It does NOT reintroduce what the 2026-05-27 audit removed. That measured ~50
// synchronous disk syncs/sec from per-INFO flush (a ~2000-line dedup burst over
// ~40 s) visibly tanking FPS. This caps the same work at ONE sync/sec regardless
// of line rate -- 1/50th of the cost that was rejected -- and a quiet log flushes
// nothing at all, because the check rides an existing write rather than a timer.
// The per-line cost added is one GetTickCount64(), which reads KUSER_SHARED_DATA
// with no syscall; its ~15.6 ms granularity is irrelevant against a 1 s interval.
//
// RESIDUAL, stated rather than discovered later: dispatch plus the bounded quiet
// wait below can put the durable file about two seconds behind during continuous
// logging. A hard kill inside that window can lose that tail; it cannot lose an
// unbounded session the way the old CRT-only buffering did.
