// ---- THE game-side answer, read from THE GAME'S OWN GUARD ----
//
// MEASURED 2026-07-31, mainPlayer's ubergraph (research/bp_reflection, decoded with
// kdec.py -- the block that handles every key):
//
//     CallFunc_IsValid_ReturnValue_99 = IsValid(activeInterface)
//     POP_FLOW_IF_NOT(CallFunc_IsValid_ReturnValue_99)      <-- the guard
//     WidgetInteraction.SetFocus(activeInterface)
//     WidgetInteraction.PressPointerKey[virt](key)
//     CallFunc_PressKey_ReturnValue = WidgetInteraction.PressKey[virt](key, false)
//
// The game forwards a typed key into the focused widget IFF `activeInterface` is valid,
// and it delivers it through a VIRTUAL USER (WidgetInteraction has its own
// VirtualUserIndex). That is why the obvious predicate cannot work here:
// `UWidget::HasKeyboardFocus()` asks about USER 0, so it is structurally blind to every
// in-world widget screen -- the SAT console, the laptop, the arcade, the TV, the radar,
// the portable PC -- whose UMG lives in a UWidgetComponent driven by mainPlayer's
// UWidgetInteractionComponent.
//
// The predicate used to be `iface && IsLive(iface) && HasKeyboardFocus(iface)`: it read
// the RIGHT field and then threw the answer away on a question the engine answers about
// a different user. GitHub issue #5's console is the case that got wrong; the player
// inventory is the case that made it look right, because `setActiveInterface` ALSO calls
// SetInputMode_GameAndUIEx, which focuses the same widget for user 0. Two delivery
// paths, one of them never modelled.

// The local pawn, as last validated BY THE TICK. Never resolved from the WndProc.
//
// `Registry::Local()` looks like a pure cache read and is not: on a cold cache it runs
// RescanLocal(), which calls E::GetController() -- a REFLECTED UFunction, i.e.
// ProcessEvent. Our own PE detour then sees a non-empty queue at top level and runs
// DrainPostedTasksAtTopLevel(), so spawns, wire applies and net_pump::Tick would execute
// synchronously INSIDE a WM_KEYDOWN callback, re-entering the engine at a point that is
// not a tick boundary. `t_inPump` does not protect this: a WndProc is not inside a pump.
// Reachable for real -- a world change now invalidates the registry's cache through
// the CachedObjRef world stamp (2026-08-23; this comment used to cite InvalidateLocal(),
// which never had a caller and is deleted), and the first keypress after a travel would
// pay for the refill. So the tick owns the resolve and the keystroke path only
// re-validates. CachedObjRef: probed per
// WndProc message INCLUDING at the menu -> the runner-up suspect of the
// IsLive/VEH finding (islive-zeroav design section 3).
