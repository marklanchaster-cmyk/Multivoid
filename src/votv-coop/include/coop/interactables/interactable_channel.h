// coop/interactable_channel.h -- the GENERIC keyed-interactable replication engine
// (the Adapter vtable + the Channel class), extracted from interactable_sync.cpp
// (RULE 2026-05-25: that TU crossed the 800-LOC soft cap once the 4th/5th feature
// adapter landed -- the generic engine is the natural seam, so it moves to its own
// header and the feature file keeps only the per-feature adapters + the public facade).
//
// This is the SHARED machinery for ALL keyed interactables (doors / light switches /
// container lids / garage / appliances / ...): the key->actor index with self-heal,
// per-key dedup, deferred-apply + throttled retry, echo-suppress, connect-snapshot,
// and the HostAuth hold-register (doors). Each feature is just an `Adapter` (a vtable
// over its ue_wrap engine wrapper) + a file-static `Channel` instance; adding a feature
// is an adapter + a few facade lines, never a copy of this engine.
//
// Header-only inline (one includer: interactable_sync.cpp). It carries no per-feature
// engine specifics -- which class / which Key offset / which open-close UFunction all
// live behind the Adapter. Principle 7: this is the generic transport, the adapters are
// the per-class glue.
