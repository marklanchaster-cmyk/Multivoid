// "A session is a host listening on a port + zero..kMaxPeers-1 clients connected."
// Session owns the GameNetworkingSockets connection(s) and runs a dedicated net
// thread that drives RunCallbacks + ReceiveMessagesOnPollGroup (host) /
// ReceiveMessagesOnConnection (client). Game thread <-> net thread bridge is
// pose slots + a reliable inbox.
//
// PR-2 swapped the hand-rolled Winsock UDP for GNS. PR-3 added 3 priority lanes.
// PR-4 (this file) generalizes to kMaxPeers connections via a PollGroup on
// host. Per-peer remote pose storage is indexed by `peerSlot` matching
// coop::players::Registry's indexing (slot 0 = host, slots 1..kMaxPeers-1 =
// clients). On host, slot 0 is unused for remote state (it's local); slots
// 1..3 hold remote-client poses. On client, slot 0 holds the host's pose;
// slots 1..3 unused (host-authoritative model -- clients only talk to host).
//
// Topology-blind: per the forward-compat plan
// (research/findings/network/votv-gns-p2p-masterserver-plan-2026-05-28.md), every code
// path below is topology-agnostic except Session::Start. P2P + master server
// will add a sibling branch in Start; the multi-peer storage / PollGroup /
// status callback / lanes / receive loop all work unchanged for any
// HSteamNetConnection origin (LAN direct, ICE-signaled P2P, future SDR).
