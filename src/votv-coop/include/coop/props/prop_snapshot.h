// coop/prop_snapshot.h -- Phase 5S0 save snapshot bootstrap.
//
// USER DIRECTIVE 2026-05-24 ("client just reconnects to the host's game
// and all objects and states are force synced"): when the session reaches
// Connected, host enumerates every live Aprop_C derivative in GUObjectArray
// and broadcasts a PropSpawn for each. Client OnSpawn de-dupes on
// FindByKeyString -- existing actors are skipped; missing actors are
// created; transform mismatches converge to host's truth.
//
// Two-phase design (audit I-2 2026-05-24; enumeration source updated
// 2026-05-28 per H2-redux):
//   Phase 1 (TriggerForSlot on host-connected edge): snapshot-copies
//   prop_lifecycle's maintained known-keyed-props set into the local
//   candidate vector. The set is seeded ONCE at Install via a single
//   GUObjectArray walk and kept current via Init POST insert +
//   K2_DestroyActor PRE evict -- per-reconnect cost is O(set-size)
//   pointer copy (~2000) instead of O(GUObjectArray) walk (~150k).
//   No ProcessEvent dispatch.
//   Phase 2 (per NetPumpTick): drain kSnapshotChunkSize=100 candidates,
//   reading their transforms and calling SendReliableToSlot. The
//   reliable channel buffers internally; ~330-500 ms total wall-clock,
//   spread across frames.
