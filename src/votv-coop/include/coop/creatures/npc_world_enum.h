// coop/npc_world_enum.h -- HOST-side OFF-INTERCEPTOR NPC enrollment.
//
// Extracted from npc_sync.cpp (K-0, 2026-06-16) per the 800-LOC soft cap; concept widened
// 2026-07-03. ONE domain concept: enrolling host NPCs the PE interceptor can NEVER see,
// through the SAME end state the interceptor+POST reach for a fresh spawn (Npc Element
// alloc + bound live actor + reverse-map entry [+ EntitySpawn broadcast]). Two members:
//   1. The GUObjectArray WALK (RegisterExistingWorldNpcs) -- actors that loaded WITH the
//      level, before the interceptor installed.
//   2. The EX_CALLMATH SPAWN CATCH (InstallExSpawnCatch/DrainPendingExSpawns) -- actors a
//      BP ubergraph spawns via EX_CallMath BeginDeferred, which routes UFunction::Func ONE
//      LAYER BELOW ProcessEvent (docs/COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md): the PE interceptor+POST
//      register but never fire. Caught by the ufunction_hook Func-thunk; SOURCE-GATED by
//      the spawning actor's class (FFrame::Object) to the event-swarm spawners
//      (trigger_wispSwarm_C -> wisp_C), so per-peer AMBIENT spawners (ticker_wispSpawner's
//      wisp_C, weight 100 of ~108 in its cooked table) stay local by design -- the same
//      standing decision as the colored wisp siblings. The catch fires PRE-Finish
//      (transform unset), so it only QUEUES; the drain enrolls next pump tick, when
//      FinishSpawningActor has run and the transform is real.
//
// Consumes npc_sync's host-side lifecycle state through its public accessors only
// (GetSession / IsInstalled / IsHostNpcSyncDisabled / IsAllowlistedClass /
// GetNpcIdForActor / MapActorToNpcId) + the shared MirrorManager<Npc> singleton --
// it owns no private npc_sync state. Game thread.

// Why a newly-registered NPC's EntitySpawn carries savePersisted=1 (adopt a local twin) vs 0
// (fresh-spawn a mirror) depends on the CALLER's intent, NOT the actor's has-a-key property:
//  - ConnectEdge:        host world-load init (subsystems). The broadcast (re)reaches a JOINER who
//                        loaded the same save -> it MAY have a local twin of a keyed save object ->
//                        savePersisted = HasSaveKey(obj). [the v75 connect-edge adoption contract]
//  - MidSessionConverge: a kerfur turned ON mid-session (kerfur_convert). The broadcast reaches
//                        ALREADY-CONNECTED peers who have NO twin (they cancelled their own local
//                        turn-on) -> ALWAYS savePersisted=0 -> fresh-spawn now. A turn-on kerfur has
//                        a random UCS-minted key so HasSaveKey is true, but the key is meaningless to
//                        a peer that never loaded it -> routing it into the deferred adoption poll
//                        causes an ~8s pop-in + a class-only false-bind dupe (RCA 2026-06-15). This
//                        matches the runtime-interceptor send, which already hardcodes savePersisted=0
//                        for the same "spawned after the join, no local twin" reason.

// so they never went through the intercepted BeginDeferred and were never registered. Register each
// as a host Npc Element (alloc + bind the live actor + reverse-map) -- the same end state the
