// coop/npc_sync.h -- Phase 5N1 NPC sync foundation.
//
// Engine-level interceptor on UGameplayStatics::BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass
// that:
//   - On HOST: optionally broadcasts EntitySpawn for allowlisted NPC classes
//     (gated by VOTVCOOP_NPC_SYNC=1 -- Inc2 ships the wire layer but the
//     client-side materializer is Inc3).
//   - On CLIENT: suppresses NPC spawns (allowlist matched by SuperStruct walk)
//     so only host-streamed NPCs exist on the client. Wire-received NPC
//     spawns bypass the suppressor via the MarkIncomingNpcSpawn slot.
//
// Idempotent install: Install() is called every NetPumpTick. The first successful core-seam
// call caches the session pointer, makes one synchronous allowlist resolve pass, and installs
// the BeginDeferred interceptor. Late allowlist classes arrive through the shared sliced scan
// hub; further Install calls short-circuit.
//
// SPLIT (M-1 2026-05-29): the client-side receiver functions (OnEntitySpawn /
// OnEntityDestroy) live in `coop/npc_mirror.h` -- this file owns host-side
// PRE/POST/interceptor + resolution + lifecycle. The receivers consume the
// resolved UFunction refs through `npc_mirror::SetClientRefs(...)` (called
// once by Install when all refs become available) and access the shared
// allowlist + session pointer + bypass slot through the public accessors
// below.

// are usable immediately and missing slots are discovered by the shared sliced scan hub.
// The host lifecycle path may still be disabled (g_npcSyncDisabledThisProcess)

// retrying; IsInstalled() is then true with NOTHING resolved. That is safe for
// the only caller (the client reconcile sweep): IsAllowlistedClass returns
// false for unresolved slots, so the sweep classifies nothing and destroys
// nothing -- a benign no-op on a build where NPC sync is dead anyway. A caller
// MUST NOT gate broader world-ready logic on the interceptor being live
// (NPC-class load timing must never block prop/door replay). Used by net_pump
// to time the client-NPC reconcile sweep (npc_mirror::DestroyUntrackedClient-
// Npcs). Game thread.

// True iff Install permanently disabled the host NPC lifecycle this process (the observer table
// was full at Install -> no guaranteed POST/destroy observer). The extracted world-enum
// (coop/npc_world_enum) gates on this + IsInstalled() before allocating any Npc Element -- the
// SAME gate the interceptor uses, so it never leaks an Element with no destroy observer to close
// it. Atomic; any thread.

// weather_lightning's OnSpawnPostLightning both target BeginDeferred, and the old
// one-cb-per-UFunction observer table silently OVERWROTE npc_sync's slot. Commit
// eb3282d (multi-observer-per-UFunction, 2026-05-30 16:58 -- 4h after that note)
// gave each (target, cb) its own slot so both fire; the note was never re-checked
// until the 2026-06-07 npctest above proved POST-bound=1.
