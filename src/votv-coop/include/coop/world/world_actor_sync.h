// coop/world_actor_sync.h -- HOST-AUTHORITATIVE mirror of NON-Character event actors (B3b, 2026-06-17).
//
// The "sync all events" arc (research/findings/events/votv-all-events-coop-sync-classification-2026-06-17.md,
// channel B3 / the B3b split) + the design doc votv-b3b-worldactor-mirror-design-2026-06-17.md.
// Mirrors the ~14 non-Character event actors (gray saucers, Rozital mothership, ariral ships, sky UFO,
// space jellyfish, firetank, ...) that fly in on events. The Character-only NPC mirror (npc_sync +
// npc_pose_drive) can't replicate them: it drives pos + YAW-ONLY rotation + DriveCharacterMovement
// (CMC@0x288, ACharacter-only). So this is a SELF-CONTAINED sibling of npc_sync -- its own
// coop::element::WorldActor element (transform-only, FULL rotation), its own MirrorManager<WorldActor>,
// its own wire (WorldActorSpawn/WorldActorDestroy reliable + MsgType::WorldActorPose unreliable batch),
// and its own SECOND interceptor on BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass (the WorldActor allowlist is
// DISJOINT from npc_sync's, so the two interceptors are conflict-free -- game_thread.h multi-interceptor
// support). It does NOT extend the kerfur-coupled Npc, and does NOT touch npc_sync.
//
// HOST-AUTHORITATIVE (clients run a dormant event scheduler -- time_sync pins their TimeScale=0 -- so
// they never fire an event themselves; the host is the sole event producer):
//   - host interceptor: an allowlisted spawn -> allocate a WorldActor Element + broadcast WorldActorSpawn
//     (WorldActorSpawnPayload). Lets the spawn proceed (returns false).
//   - host POST observer (same UFunction): bind the returned AActor* + actor->eid reverse map.
//   - host K2_DestroyActor PRE observer: broadcast WorldActorDestroy + release the Element.
//   - host TickPoseStream (~sendHz): read each live WA's transform -> publish ONE WorldActorPose batch.
//   - client interceptor: SUPPRESS an allowlisted local spawn (defense-in-depth -- the dormant scheduler
//     shouldn't fire one anyway) unless the bypass slot matches a wire-received materialization.
//   - client OnWorldActorSpawn: materialize a transform-only mirror (BeginDeferred + FinishSpawning),
//     park it (SetActorTickEnabled(false) -- generic, no CMC read), Install into MirrorManager<WorldActor>.
//   - client OnWorldActorDestroy: K2_DestroyActor the mirror + drop the Element.
//   - client TickClientWorldActors: drain the latest WorldActorPose batch + drive every mirror's interp.
//   - host QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot: re-send WorldActorSpawn (+ current transform) for every live WA
//     to a fresh joiner so it mirrors actors that spawned before it joined.

// ---- v137: who is a MIRROR, and when is one being born --------------------------------------------
// Added for coop/items/coingun_sync, which must decide -- inside a component-overlap delegate -- whether
// the coin it is looking at is a host-owned mirror (suppress: a client never credits) or genuine local
// content (leave native: `[V]` two cooked maps carry PLACED baocoin_C, and cancelling those would make
// them permanently uncollectable AND ghosted, which is a NEW loss).
//
// Two calls because ONE is not enough: a mirror's component-bound delegates bind during BeginPlay, i.e.
// INSIDE FinishSpawningActor, BEFORE the mirror row is installed -- so a row lookup alone loses the race
// for anything seeded onto a peer standing where the actor lands. Consumers test `IsMirroredActor() ||
// IsMaterializingMirror()`.

// True if `actor` is a live wire-materialized mirror on this peer. O(1). Any thread.
bool IsMirroredActor(void* actor);

// Register/unregister a materialized mirror. Called by the mirror path only. Any thread.
void NoteMirrorActor(void* actor, bool add);

// Drop every entry. Called from the teardown drain -- the set is keyed on a raw pointer, so it must
// not outlive the mirrors (a recycled address would otherwise make a genuine local actor read as a
// mirror). Any thread.
void ClearMirrorActors();

// True while THIS THREAD is inside a mirror materialization (BeginDeferred..FinishSpawning inclusive),
// which is exactly the window in which a mirror's BeginPlay runs and its delegates bind.
bool IsMaterializingMirror();

// The element id of the mirror THIS THREAD is materializing right now, or 0 outside the window.
//
// v140: knowing the window is open is not enough for a consumer that must NAME the actor being born.
// The collect lane learned this the expensive way -- it suppressed a pickup on `mirror OR
// materializing` and then tried to forward it on `mirror` alone, so a coin collected inside its own
// materialization was cancelled and never forwarded: neither peer credited it. One question must have
// one answer, so the window now carries the identity the mirror path already has in hand.
//
// USE IT AS A FALLBACK, NEVER AS THE FIRST ANSWER: the window belongs to the actor being SPAWNED, and
// registering that actor's collision can fire delegates on OTHER, already-mirrored actors it lands
// on. Ask the actor for its own eid first; reach for this only when the actor has none AND the window
// is open, which is precisely the not-yet-installed case.

// the window a consumer needs to identify it in.
//
// THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE WINDOW ANSWERABLE ABOUT AN ACTOR (audit I-7, 2026-08-25).
// `IsMaterializingMirror()` takes no actor, so a consumer that ORs it into an "is this actor a
// mirror?" predicate is really asking "is SOME mirror being born right now", and during any
// materialization every unrelated coin, prop or pile a player touches answers yes. Compare against
// this instead: `IsMirroredActor(a) || MaterializingActor() == a`.
