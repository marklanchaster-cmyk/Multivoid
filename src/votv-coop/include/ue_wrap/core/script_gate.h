// ue_wrap/core/script_gate.h -- observe and cancel a Blueprint function body, per call, on every
// route. Every script function body the VM runs, however it was reached (ProcessEvent, a
// Blueprint's own local or virtual call, a call through a context switch, an ubergraph entry),
// executes inside one engine function, the VM's local script loop, which receives the frame
// already built: the instance, the function, the evaluated parameters, the caller's frame. A
// MinHook detour on that loop is therefore the one seam that sees every call with its arguments
// and can refuse to run the body. Consumers watch a UFunction (exact object) or a function name
// (every class's function of that name), get a pre callback with the frame and a verdict, and a
// post callback after the body. The MTA shape is the multiplayer_sa hook layer: a detour at the
// game function's entry, a handler that returns whether the original runs
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Client/multiplayer_sa/CMultiplayerSA.cpp:6355, ProcessCollisionHandler).
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7): no gameplay or network logic.

// call; both are null when the call came through ProcessEvent (an engine event, a delegate, a
// timer, or a reflected call of ours). `result` is where the return expression writes, and may
// be null. Fires on the game thread only; an off-thread match is a counted tripwire.
